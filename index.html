            Hi! I'm Igor and I am a problem solving enthusiast. My favorite way of solving
            problems is programming - from electronics to abstract math. I started my programming
            journey with Arduino when I was around 15 and I remember that it was quite hard to get 
            myself to keep my interest in anything - blinking LED's is exciting for the first fifteen minutes. 
            It was until I got the idea to make my sister a lamp that would turn on with a clap. I went
            crazy about it - I learned how to solder and started to really learn programming. I did not 
            realise how formative seeing someone excited at something I made really was. After that I
            wanted to one-up myself and for my personal project at school I made an automatic shifter
            for a bike. This was next level for me - from understanding how derailleur works through
            building bracket for a motor to writing code - it was amazing. After that I wanted to try
            some "real" programming so I played around with C and C++ with some simple project, but like 
            in the case of Arduino it was boring to write code that serves little to no purpose. At the 
            time I was attending a computer science class and we were writing pseudocode - it was very obnoxious
            as in the existing tool there was no error detection and you had to inspect the code for the littlest
            typo. That's why I decided to write an interpreter. I fired up Vim, copied CMakeList from StackOverflow
            and got to work. In the span of three months I went from barely understanding what a pointer is to 
            simulating a call stack. Suddenly compilers and interpreters stopped being a black box to me but also
            made me realise how ignorant I am. Now I am more hungry for knowledge than ever and keep on 
            exploring the world of abstraction.

            Hi! My name is Igor and I love solving problems and building stuff. I am going 
            for breadth rather than depth, hence my projects are all over the place - from automatic 
            bike shifter to an interpreter.
